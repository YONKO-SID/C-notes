# C Programming Learning Notes

Welcome to my comprehensive collection of C programming notes! This repository contains a structured set of lessons designed to take a learner from the very basics of C to more advanced topics like pointers, structs, and file I/O.

These notes were created as part of my journey to master C and are intended to be a helpful resource for anyone else learning this powerful language. Each lesson is self-contained, includes conceptual links to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and is accompanied by a homework project to solidify understanding.

## About the Notes

These notes are organized into lessons, each in its own Markdown file. The lessons follow a logical progression, building upon concepts from previous lessons.

### Key Features:

* **Structured Lessons:** Clear, organized explanations of core C concepts.
* **Code Examples:** Practical examples to illustrate each topic.
* **DSA Relevance:** Each lesson highlights how the concepts are fundamental to Data Structures and Algorithms.
* **Homework Projects:** Hands-on exercises to practice and apply what you've learned.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**

&nbsp;   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YONKO-SID/C-notes.git
    ```

2. **Navigate the lessons:** Start with Lesson 1 and work your way through the material.
3. **Do the homework:** The best way to learn is by doing. Compile and run the examples, and complete the homework projects for each lesson.
4. I have already solved most of the homework questions and they will be in a different repository.
